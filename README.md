# **Magic the Gathering Forge: Custom card set - Kantai Collection**
## Introduction:

This Repo Stores codes for Kantai Collection extension set for Magic the Gathering: Forge. Starting with photoshopping every single picture and using an application on iPhone called CardCreator, the development procedure shifted MSE. The scripting was done with VSCode and batch for injections. Each card in the set is designed under EDH card power standards. Althought, this set can be played as a standalone set, the set isn't meant to be played with standard/pioneer power level cards. Ideally this set finishes with roughly 350 cards fully scripted and fine tuned.

### About forge:

*Forge is an implementation of Magic the Gathering that lets you play against a computer AI opponent using most of the rules of a real game. You can construct decks for you and the computer to play with, currently 18475 (and counting) cards are available. We now include over 100 schemes, vanguards and planes. You can also play in a draft, sealed deck format or in a gauntlet against the computer. There is a new variant game mode that lets you play against multiple computer opponents. Currently, this program only lets you play against the computer, you cannot play against another human player over the Internet.*

### Written in:

- Batch:

> ### **Batch:**
> A batch file is a script file in DOS, OS/2, and Microsoft Windows. It consists of a series of commands to be executed by the command-line interpreter, stored in a plain text file. A batch file may contain any command the interpreter accepts interactively and use constructs that enable conditional branching and looping within the batch file, such as IF, FOR, and GOTO labels. The term "batch" is from batch processing, meaning "non-interactive execution", though a batch file may not process a batch of multiple data.

### Some md helps:

* Text attributes _italic_, **bold**, `monospace`.
* ~~strikethrough~~
* Lists: site #3
1. Rest
2. Quarter Notes
3. An [example](http://example.com).

PS: I know this card is broken in pieces. This card was first created under this set using Photoshop which serves a symbolic purpose for this set and wasn't designed from a playable card perspective.
